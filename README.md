# Preppers

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Overview

For this project a group of 4 people collaborated to create a full-stack application using react. Our team wanted to make an app where people can connect and communicate with many others to help and prepare for potential emergencies or disasters.

The app features a login/ registration system and a timeline of post that are shown vertically on the screen. User's registration information is saved to our database. There is also an "add a friend" system implemented in our app. Much like other social apps, our app features a direct messages page, that allows users to privately chat will another user.


## User Statement

As a user 
I WANT to connect with friends, family and others
SO THAT I can be informed about potential disasters, view post from other members, and share my own thoughts and opinions on certain situations happening around the world.
